# RFIDTapInOut

Here is some simple code for an ESP32-OLED + MFRC522 RFID scanner.

The ESP32-OLED requires a special pinout so you will need to swap your pins.h file. I have incldued both the original and modified versions here.

We use this at our school to log pupils going to music lessons, vistiing the school matron and arriving or leaving the school site.

This code can be used by anyone if it is of any use.
